## Design

### Color Scheme

<img src="documentation/colour_pallette.png" height="75%" width="75%" />  

- I spent time creating the images for the site with my desired colours, once I had these I then extracted certain colours to use for font and other imagery.

- Oxford Blue was used as the main background colour of the website as a fall back for if the images dont render.

- Robin Egg Blue was used as the primary colour with Coral as the secondary colour, as I found these to bring out the transcendance and magic of the Norse myth.
Creating a softer image of something that once ruled the minds and belief systems of so many people hundreds of years ago.

- Delft Blue and Berkley Blue were used as the main button and CTA primary colour and highlight colour as a contrast away from the 
primary colours of the site and be more noticeable for the user scrolling.

### Typography

![Primary Font](documentation/russo_one.png)

- Russo One Google Font was used as the main font of the website in order to increase readability, but to also portray the structure like feel that the belief in Asgard brought to the Vikings.

![Secondary Font](documentation/kanit.png)

- Kanit Google Font was used to be easy to read in large paragraphs, but be somewhat different from the primary font.


### Wireframes

#### All screen sizes

    - The God Menu hover effect was inspired by and created using a CSS Youtube tutorial by Lun Dev. 
    This allowed me to create something that normally would require Javascript. The tutorial can be viewed [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P80sM7ausCA).
    - The Glassmorphic backgrounds on the blurbs of the site, were created using another Lun Dev tutorial as see [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnC-kuL_CYw).

+ #### Media

    - All the images for the website were created using text to image AI in [Adobe Firefly](https://www.adobe.com/uk/products/firefly.html).

    - [Compress PNG](https://compresspng.com/) was used to compress PNG images.
    - [Convert PNG to WEBP](https://convertio.co/png-webp/) was used to convert PNG images to WEBP.
