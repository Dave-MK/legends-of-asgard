# LEGENDS OF ASGARD
#### Welcome to the readme file for the Legends of Asgard website!

## Purpose
### This site has been created for a project while undertaking the Code Institute Level 5 Diploma - Web Application Development. 
### The purpose of this site is to showcase my proficiency in the following, of which I will also be assessed:

####  AGILE PM | UX/UI PRINCIPLES | HTML5 | CSS3 

## Criteria

>  _________________________________________________________
>   ## About
>   ### Legends of Asgard is an informational website centred around the Old Norse Gods/Goddesses, the Aesir and Vanir.
>   
>   ### The site will contain:
>   - A one page structure with mobile first design
>   - 10 sections in total:
>       - A hero containing CTAs with a mobile first approach, with sticky side menu
>       - 7 sectiona each for the Sagas of the Norse Gods
>       - A section containing information about the 9 realms/worlds of norse mythology
>       - A contact section in the footer
>
>   ## User Stories & Target Audience
>   - Aimed at people of all ages and backgrounds, this site is created with entertainment as this is centered around Norse Mythology, so nothing is stated as factual.
>   - The site is perfect for anyone interested in the Norse culture, whether knowledgeable already or none prior.
>
>   ## Directional reasoning
>   - Some original decisions made in the planning phase were reviewed during development:
>       - Originally it was planned to utilise Bootstrap for the layout and style support, but it became apparent
>       that using Bootstrap would complicate and potentially cause issues when creating some of the custom CSS rules
>       - The menu and sections were originally planned to be a carousel, but opted for a linear flow during development as to
>       prevent confusion and ensure a simple flow of content and readability
>       - Originally the animated menu on larger screens was to be laid out along the bottom of the page,
>       but I decided that in-line with the above change, the menu would flow better fixed to the right side of the page
>       - Each section was to have a header with an image of the god and the name, but due to the image size and
>       portability, I decided to make each section fill the viewport with a full background image, this ensures
>       that when moving from device to device users will have the same experience
>       - A share icon was originally planned, but this was forsaken during development as browsers provide this functionality
>       and I saw this as an extra icon/distraction away from the content
>       - The plan was to have a tree of gods and how each relates to one another, but during development this was proven
>       to be more work than originally perceived and so altered this to be a list of the nine realms with tooltip info

## Design
- Structure
    - Being an informational site, I wanted users to have an experience similar to reading a kindle book
    and so went for a one page structure separated into sections for a user friendly experience
    - A linear, one page approach I feel was justified when designing with a mobile first approach,
    but using media queries easily ensuring content is responsive and suitable for larger devices
    - A mobile menu is availble for small devices, but is transformed into an animated carousel menu
    for larger devices or smaller devices that are landscape orientation
    - I have depicted my thoughts in my wireframes, though some changes came later

- Imagery
    - This was a painstaking process, as I wanted something that makes the content seem new or refreshing
    - Rather than use stock images, that appeared bland and lacked imagination, my images and realm icons 
    were generated using adobe firefly text to image prompts, but proved fruitful once I had the 
    overall theme and idea in mind
    - Creating the images helped finalise the colour design choices for the overall site

- Colour
    - As mentioned above I had an idea of a general colour design, which I tested various times during
    the gathering of the images
    - Once I had settled on the theme of the images, I then colour picked based on the overall shadows,
    midtones and highlights of the images
    - There was some small alterations once in development to ensure text properly contrasted from the background
