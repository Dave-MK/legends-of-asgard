+ #### YGGDRASSIL

    - Originally planned to be a tree of the gods showing links and relationships, but realised
    during development that this would be more time consuming than originally planned.

    - This is the section that shows the nine realms in norse myth instead.

    - Each realm is hoverable and when hovered displays a tooltip with a description.

## Design

### Color Scheme

![Color pallet](documentation/color_pallet.png)

- Soft blue color was used as the main color of the website due to its phycological effect on people's minds. As this color is associated with trustworthiness and reliability, website visitors could build a firm believe in the organization "Animal Shelter".

- Light Blue Color was used as a background color since this color creates a sense of tranquility and makes a connection between animal's ownership and peacefulness.

- Purple color was used to make an emphasis on the logo and leave a memorable effect on the website visitors.

### Typography

![Main Font](documentation/primary_font.png)

- Lato Google Font was used as the main font of the website in order to increase readability of the content on the pages.
