                <h2>YMIR</h2>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        In the timeless void of Ginnungagap, frost from the icy realm of Niflheim met the searing flames
                        of Muspellheim. From the melting ice emerged Ymir, a towering figure born of chaos. Ymir slept,
                        and from his armpits and legs sprang other giants, representing the unbridled forces of nature.
                        Ymir’s existence was unruly, his presence a threat to the ordered cosmos yet to come.
                        <br><br>
                        Nearby, the great cow Audhumla appeared, licking the salty ice. From the ice emerged Búri, the
                        first of the gods, who begot Borr, father to Odin, Vili, and Ve. Recognizing Ymir’s
                        uncontrollable power, the three brothers plotted to end his reign. In a titanic battle, they
                        slew Ymir, whose blood gushed out to drown most of his giant offspring.
                        <br><br>
                        From Ymir’s body, the gods created the world: <br>
                        His skull became the sky, where stars were fixed.
                        His flesh formed the land.
                        His blood created the oceans, and his teeth and bones became mountains and cliffs.
                        His eyelashes were fashioned into the walls of Midgard, the world of humans.
                        Yet Ymir’s kin, the surviving jötnar, fled to Jötunheim and bore an everlasting grudge, sowing
                        the seeds of conflict between gods and giants.

                <h2>ODIN</h2>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        Odin, chief of the Æsir, was defined by his relentless pursuit of knowledge and power. Early in
                        his reign, Odin sought the wisdom of Mímir, guardian of the well beneath Yggdrasil. To drink
                        from its waters, Odin offered one of his eyes. The sacrifice left him with unmatched insight
                        into the workings of the cosmos, though he was forever marked by the price of knowledge.
                        <br><br>
                        Later, Odin sought mastery of runes, magical symbols holding the secrets of creation, destiny,
                        and power. To attain them, he performed a greater sacrifice: he pierced himself with his spear,
                        Gungnir, and hung from Yggdrasil’s branches for nine nights and nine days, teetering on the edge
                        of life and death. As he hung, the tree whispered its secrets, and Odin grasped the runes,
                        becoming the god of magic, poetry, and prophecy.
                        <br><br>
                        But even Odin’s knowledge brought sorrow. Through his visions, he foresaw the events of
                        Ragnarök, where he would fall to Fenrir, Loki’s monstrous wolf-son. Knowing his fate, Odin
                        tirelessly prepared for the end, assembling the Einherjar (warriors chosen from the slain) and
                        plotting strategies to delay the inevitable.

                <h2>THOR</h2>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        Thor, son of Odin and the earth goddess Jörð, embodied strength and protection. With his hammer
                        Mjölnir, Thor waged unceasing war against the jötnar, who threatened the stability of the
                        realms. Yet Thor was not just a warrior—he was also a protector of Midgard and a symbol of
                        unyielding determination.
                        <br><br>
                        One of Thor’s greatest trials involved the Utgard-Loki, a giant who tricked him through
                        illusions. Thor was challenged to drink from a horn, unaware it was connected to the sea; his
                        efforts created the tides. He tried to lift a massive cat, not realizing it was Jörmungandr, the
                        World Serpent in disguise. Lastly, he wrestled an old crone who was Elli, the personification of
                        old age, and found her unbeatable. These tests taught Thor humility, though they also
                        foreshadowed his final battle with Jörmungandr at Ragnarök.
                        <br><br>
                        Another famous tale recounts the theft of Mjölnir by Thrym, who demanded Freyja as his bride.
                        Disguised as Freyja, Thor infiltrated the giant’s hall, and when Mjölnir was brought to bless
                        the marriage, Thor seized it and unleashed his fury, slaying Thrym and restoring his hammer to
                        protect the worlds.

                <h2>TYR</h2>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        Tyr was revered for his unwavering commitment to law and sacrifice. In the age of prophecy, the
                        gods learned that Loki’s son, Fenrir, would grow to devour Odin during Ragnarök. They sought to
                        bind the wolf, first with chains of iron, which Fenrir easily shattered. Finally, they
                        commissioned the dwarves to forge Gleipnir, a silken ribbon imbued with impossible elements: the
                        roots of a mountain, the beard of a woman, the sound of a cat’s footsteps, and the breath of a
                        fish.
                        <br><br>
                        Fenrir, sensing trickery, agreed to be bound only if one god placed their hand in his mouth.
                        Tyr, knowing the cost, stepped forward. As the ribbon tightened, Fenrir thrashed and bit off
                        Tyr’s hand, leaving the god maimed. Though Tyr bore the loss stoically, his act ensured Fenrir’s
                        restraint until Ragnarök, when the wolf would break free.
                        <br><br>
                        Tyr’s sacrifice embodied the ideals of honor and justice, showing that the preservation of order
                        often demands personal loss.

                <div>
                    <p>
                        Angrboða, a fearsome jötunn from Jötunheim, lived apart from the gods, shrouded in mystery and
                        power. Her union with Loki resulted in three fateful children:
                        <br><br>
                        Fenrir, the wolf destined to kill Odin.
                        Jörmungandr, the serpent who encircles the world and battles Thor.
                        Hel, the somber ruler of the underworld.
                        The gods, fearing the prophecy of Ragnarök, acted swiftly. They bound Fenrir with Gleipnir, cast
                        Jörmungandr into the ocean, and banished Hel to Niflheim, granting her dominion over the dead.
                        Angrboða, devastated by the loss of her children, became an enduring symbol of grief and
                        vengeance.
                        <br><br>
                        Her prophetic abilities shaped the course of events, and her children fulfilled their roles
                        during Ragnarök, fulfilling her warnings to the gods.

                <h2>FREYJA</h2>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        Freyja, goddess of love and war, was also a practitioner of seiðr, a form of magic dealing with
                        fate and transformation. She taught this craft to Odin, making it a central aspect of Norse
                        mysticism. Freyja’s beauty captivated gods and mortals alike, but it was her necklace,
                        Brísingamen, that symbolized her power.
                        <br><br>
                        When Freyja sought to acquire the necklace, she encountered four dwarves who demanded she spend
                        a night with each of them in exchange. Freyja agreed, valuing the treasure above all else. The
                        necklace became her most prized possession, a symbol of her dual nature as a goddess of love and
                        fierce independence.
                        <br><br>
                        As a leader of the Valkyries, Freyja claimed half the warriors who died in battle, welcoming
                        them to her hall, Fólkvangr. Freyja’s domain over life, death, and magic made her one of the
                        most complex deities in Norse mythology.

                <h2>FREYR</h2>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        Freyr, the twin brother of Freyja, was a god of abundance and peace, revered for bringing
                        prosperity to the land. One day, Freyr spied Gerðr, a beautiful jötunn, and fell deeply in love.
                        Overcome with desire, he sent his servant Skírnir to woo her. Skírnir used both threats and
                        promises, eventually convincing Gerðr to marry Freyr.
                        <br><br>
                        To secure Gerðr’s hand, Freyr gave away his magical sword, which could fight on its own. This
                        sacrifice ensured Freyr’s happiness but left him vulnerable. During Ragnarök, Freyr faced the
                        fire giant Surtr without his weapon and was slain, a symbol of the price of love and peace.
                        <br><br>
                        Freyr’s story embodies the balance between passion and responsibility, as well as the sacrifices
                        required to sustain harmony in a turbulent world.
